# phenom_sampler
A simple advective simulator with interface for drawing snapshot and point sample observations.

In `src/` two files for *modeling* an advective system and *sampling* from a simulated system are stored. To see an example of how these files should be used, an ipython notebook is provided in `examples/` along with a sample dataset in `/data`. The model and sampler are respectively described and parameterized using YAML files which are found in `config/`.
